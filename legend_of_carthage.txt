Latin:
"In medio antiquae Romae, puer nomine Marcus magnus miles fieri ut pater suus somniavit. Dies eius studiis gladii et scuti completi erant, et noctes eius tacticas ductorum Romanorum legendariorum discere. Quo die Marcus per vias frequentes Romae ambulabat, senum quidam de fato Carthaginis loquentium audivit. 'Carthago delenda est!' exclamaverunt, voces eorum determinatione plenae. His verbis commotus, Marcus se vovit partem suam in Romae gloria confirmatura esse. Anni transierunt, et Marcus in virum fortissimum crevit. Cum tempus advenerit, fortiter in acie pugnavit, Roman defendens contra hostes et honor civitatis suae defendens. Postremo, Marcus non modo miles, sed etiam signum Romae fortitudinis et perseverantiae factus est, testimonia somnii virtute et constantia inflammati."
